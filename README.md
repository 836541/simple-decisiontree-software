PT-BR Decision Tree Software

Irrelevant Decision Tree Software I made for introductory SKLEARN learning purposes.

Ask 5 questions then you know if you are healthy or not.

2 datasets available: 

A fully predictable one (all input possibilities calculated) -> High Accuracy but not so cool

and

a Randomized one to simulate training with real data.     -> Low Accuracy (training set = 27) but cooler
