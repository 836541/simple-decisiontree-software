PT-BR Decision Tree Software

Irrelevant Decision Tree Software I made for introductory SKLEARN learning purposes.

Ask 5 questions then say if you are healthy or not.

2 datasets available: 

A fully predictable one (all input possibilities calculated)

and

a Randomized one to simulate training with real data.
